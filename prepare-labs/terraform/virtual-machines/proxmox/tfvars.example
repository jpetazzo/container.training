# If you want to deploy to Proxmox, you need to:
# 1) copy that file to e.g. myproxmoxcluster.tfvars
# 2) make sure you have a VM template with QEMU agent pre-installed
# 3) customize the copy (you need to replace all the CHANGEME values)
# 4) deploy with "labctl create --provider proxmox/myproxmoxcluster  ..."

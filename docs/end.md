  [Notary](https://github.com/docker/notary) (image signature and verification)

- Image security scanning (many products available, Docker Inc. and 3rd party)

- [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/) and
  [Docker Datacenter](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-datacenter)

## Work in progress

- Demo at least one volume plugin
  <br/>(bonus points if it's a distributed storage system)

- ..................................... (your favorite feature here)

Reminder: there is a tag for each iteration of the content
in the Github repository.

It makes it easy to come back later and check what has changed since you did it!

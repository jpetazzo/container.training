  **Be kind to the WiFi!**

  *Use the 5G network*
  <br/>
  *Don't use your hotspot*
  <br/>
  *Don't stream videos from YouTube, Netflix, etc.
  <br/>(if you're bored, watch local content instead)*

  <!--
  Also: share the power outlets
  <br/>
  *(with limited power comes limited responsibility?)*
  <br/>
  *(or something?)*
  -->

  Thank you!

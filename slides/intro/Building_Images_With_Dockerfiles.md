# Building Docker images with a Dockerfile

![construction](Building_Images_With_Dockerfiles/construction.jpg)

---

## Objectives

We will build a container image automatically, with a `Dockerfile`.

At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Write a `Dockerfile`.

* Build an image from a `Dockerfile`.

---

## `Dockerfile` overview

* A `Dockerfile` is a build recipe for a Docker image.

* It contains a series of instructions telling Docker how an image is constructed.

* The `docker build` command builds an image from a `Dockerfile`.

---

## Writing our first `Dockerfile`

Our Dockerfile must be in a **new, empty directory**.

1. Create a directory to hold our `Dockerfile`.

```bash
$ mkdir myimage
```

2. Create a `Dockerfile` inside this directory.

```bash
$ cd myimage
$ vim Dockerfile
```

Of course, you can use any other editor of your choice.

---

## Type this into our Dockerfile...

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install figlet
```

* `FROM` indicates the base image for our build.

* Each `RUN` line will be executed by Docker during the build.

* Our `RUN` commands **must be non-interactive.**
  <br/>(No input can be provided to Docker during the build.)

* In many cases, we will add the `-y` flag to `apt-get`.

---

## Build it!

Save our file, then execute:

```bash
$ docker build -t figlet .
```

* `-t` indicates the tag to apply to the image.

* `.` indicates the location of the *build context*.

We will talk more about the build context later.

To keep things simple for now: this is the directory where our Dockerfile is located.

---

## What happens when we build the image?

The output of `docker build` looks like this:

.small[
```bash
$ docker build -t figlet .
Sending build context to Docker daemon 2.048 kB

Step 0 : FROM ubuntu
 ---> e54ca5efa2e9
Step 1 : RUN apt-get update
 ---> Running in 840cb3533193

 ---> f9e8f1642759

```
]

* The output of the `RUN` commands has been omitted.
* Let's explain what this output means.

---

## Sending the build context to Docker

```bash
Sending build context to Docker daemon 2.048 kB
```

* The build context is the `.` directory given to `docker build`.

* It is sent (as an archive) by the Docker client to the Docker daemon.

* This allows to use a remote machine to build using local files.

* Be careful (or patient) if that directory is big and your link is slow.

---

## Executing each step

```bash
Step 1 : RUN apt-get update
 ---> Running in 840cb3533193
(...output of the RUN command...)
 ---> 7257c37726a1
Removing intermediate container 840cb3533193
```

* A container (`840cb3533193`) is created from the base image.

* The `RUN` command is executed in this container.

* The container is committed into an image (`7257c37726a1`).

* The build container (`840cb3533193`) is removed.

* The output of this step will be the base image for the next one.

---

## The caching system

If you run the same build again, it will be instantaneous. Why?

* After each build step, Docker takes a snapshot of the resulting image.

* Before executing a step, Docker checks if it has already built the same sequence.

* Docker uses the exact strings defined in your Dockerfile, so:

  * `RUN apt-get install figlet cowsay ` 
    <br/> is different from
    <br/> `RUN apt-get install cowsay figlet`
  
  * `RUN apt-get update` is not re-executed when the mirrors are updated

You can force a rebuild with `docker build --no-cache ...`.

---

## Running the image

The resulting image is not different from the one produced manually.

```bash
$ docker run -ti figlet
root@91f3c974c9a1:/# figlet hello
 _          _ _       
| |__   ___| | | ___  
| '_ \ / _ \ | |/ _ \ 
| | | |  __/ | | (_) |
|_| |_|\___|_|_|\___/ 
```


Yay! ðŸŽ‰

## Using image and viewing history

The `history` command lists all the layers composing an image.

For each layer, it shows its creation time, size, and creation command.

When an image was built with a Dockerfile, each layer corresponds to
a line of the Dockerfile.

```bash
$ docker history figlet
IMAGE         CREATED            CREATED BY                     SIZE
f9e8f1642759  About an hour ago  /bin/sh -c apt-get install fi  1.627 MB
7257c37726a1  About an hour ago  /bin/sh -c apt-get update      21.58 MB
07c86167cdc4  4 days ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop) CMD ["/bin   0 B
<missing>     4 days ago         /bin/sh -c sed -i 's/^#\s*\(   1.895 kB
<missing>     4 days ago         /bin/sh -c echo '#!/bin/sh'    194.5 kB
<missing>     4 days ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop) ADD file:b   187.8 MB
```

---

## Introducing JSON syntax

Most Dockerfile arguments can be passed in two forms:

* plain string:
  <br/>`RUN apt-get install figlet`

* JSON list:
  <br/>`RUN ["apt-get", "install", "figlet"]`

We are going to change our Dockerfile to see how it affects the resulting image.

---

## Using JSON syntax in our Dockerfile

Let's change our Dockerfile as follows!

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN ["apt-get", "install", "figlet"]
```

Then build the new Dockerfile.

```bash
$ docker build -t figlet .
```

---

## JSON syntax vs string syntax

Compare the new history:

```bash
$ docker history figlet
IMAGE         CREATED            CREATED BY                     SIZE
27954bb5faaf  10 seconds ago     apt-get install figlet         1.627 MB
7257c37726a1  About an hour ago  /bin/sh -c apt-get update      21.58 MB
07c86167cdc4  4 days ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop) CMD ["/bin   0 B
<missing>     4 days ago         /bin/sh -c sed -i 's/^#\s*\(   1.895 kB
<missing>     4 days ago         /bin/sh -c echo '#!/bin/sh'    194.5 kB
<missing>     4 days ago         /bin/sh -c #(nop) ADD file:b   187.8 MB
```

* JSON syntax specifies an *exact* command to execute.

* String syntax specifies a command to be wrapped within `/bin/sh -c "..."`.

---

## When to use JSON syntax and string syntax

* String syntax:

  * is easier to write
  * interpolates environment variables and other shell expressions
  * creates an extra process (`/bin/sh -c ...`) to parse the string
  * requires `/bin/sh` to exist in the container

* JSON syntax:

  * is harder to write (and read!)
  * passes all arguments without extra processing
  * doesn't create an extra process
  * doesn't require `/bin/sh` to exist in the container

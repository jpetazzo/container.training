## Our training environment

- If you are attending a tutorial or workshop:

  - a VM has been provisioned for each student

- If you are doing or re-doing this course on your own, you can:

  - install Docker locally (as explained in the chapter "Installing Docker")

  - install Docker on e.g. a cloud VM

  - use http://www.play-with-docker.com/ to instantly get a training environment

## Our Docker VM

*This section assumes that you are following this course as part of
a tutorial, training or workshop, where each student is given an
individual Docker VM.*

- The VM is created just before the training.

- It will stay up during the whole training.

- It will be destroyed shortly after the training.

- It comes pre-loaded with Docker and some other useful tools.

## Connecting to your Virtual Machine

You need an SSH client.

* On OS X, Linux, and other UNIX systems, just use `ssh`:

```bash
$ ssh <login>@<ip-address>
```

* On Windows, if you don't have an SSH client, you can download:

  * Putty (www.putty.org)

  * Git BASH (https://git-for-windows.github.io/)

  * MobaXterm (http://moabaxterm.mobatek.net)

## Our training environment

- If you are attending a live class, a VM has been provisioned for you!

- Each student gets an individual VM.

- The VM is created just before the training.

- It will stay up during the whole training.

- It will be destroyed shortly after the training.

- It comes pre-loaded with Docker and some other useful tools.

---

## Can we run Docker locally?

- If you already have Docker (or Podman) installed, you can use it!

- The VMs can be convenient if:

  - you can't/won't install Docker or Podman on your machine,

  - your local internet connection is slow.

- We're going to download many container images and distribution packages.

- If the class takes place in a venue with slow WiFi, this can slow us down.

- The remote VMs have good connectivity and downloads will be fast there.

(Initially, we provided VMs to make sure that nobody would waste time
with installers, or because they didn't have the right permissions
on their machine, etc.)

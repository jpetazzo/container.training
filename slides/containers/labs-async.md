## Running your own lab environments

- If you are doing or re-doing this course on your own, you can:

  - install [Docker Desktop][docker-desktop] or [Podman Desktop][podman-desktop]
    <br/>(available for Linux, Mac, Windows; provides a nice GUI)

  - install [Docker CE][docker-ce] or [Podman][podman]
    <br/>(for intermediate/advanced users who prefer the CLI)

  - try platforms like [Play With Docker][pwd] or [KodeKloud]
    <br/>(if you can't/won't install anything locally)

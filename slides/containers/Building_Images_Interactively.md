# Building images interactively

In this section, we will create our first container image.

It will be a basic distribution image, but we will pre-install
the package `figlet`.

We will: 

* Create a container from a base image.

* Install software manually in the container, and turn it
  into a new image.

* Learn about new commands: `docker commit`, `docker tag`, and `docker diff`.

---

## The plan

1. Create a container (with `docker run`) using our base distro of choice.

2. Run a bunch of commands to install and set up our software in the container.

3. (Optionally) review changes in the container with `docker diff`.

4. Turn the container into a new image with `docker commit`.

5. (Optionally) add tags to the image with `docker tag`.

---

## Setting up our container

Start an Ubuntu container:

```bash
$ docker run -it ubuntu
root@<yourContainerId>:#/
```

Run the command `apt-get update` to refresh the list of packages available to install.

Then run the command `apt-get install figlet` to install the program we are interested in.

```bash
root@<yourContainerId>:#/ apt-get update && apt-get install figlet
.... OUTPUT OF APT-GET COMMANDS ....
```

---

## Inspect the changes

Type `exit` at the container prompt to leave the interactive session.

Now let's run `docker diff` to see the difference between the base image
and our container.

```bash
$ docker diff <yourContainerId>
C /root
A /root/.bash_history
C /tmp
C /usr
C /usr/bin
A /usr/bin/figlet
...
```

## Docker tracks filesystem changes

As explained before:

* An image is read-only.

* When we make changes, they happen in a copy of the image.

* Docker can show the difference between the image, and its copy.

* For performance, Docker uses copy-on-write systems.
  <br/>(i.e. starting a container based on a big image
  doesn't incur a huge copy.)

---

## Copy-on-write security benefits

* `docker diff` gives us an easy way to audit changes

  (Ã  la Tripwire)

* Containers can also be started in read-only mode

  (their root filesystem will be read-only, but they can still have read-write data volumes)


---

## Commit our changes into a new image

The `docker commit` command will create a new layer with those changes,
and a new image using this new layer.

```bash
$ docker commit <yourContainerId>
<newImageId>
```

The output of the `docker commit` command will be the ID for your newly created image.

We can use it as an argument to `docker run`.

---

## Testing our new image

Let's run this image:

```bash
$ docker run -it <newImageId>
root@fcfb62f0bfde:/# figlet hello
 _          _ _       
| |__   ___| | | ___  
| '_ \ / _ \ | |/ _ \ 
| | | |  __/ | | (_) |
|_| |_|\___|_|_|\___/ 
```

It works! .emoji[ðŸŽ‰]

## Tagging images

Referring to an image by its ID is not convenient. Let's tag it instead.

We can use the `tag` command:

```bash
$ docker tag <newImageId> figlet
```

But we can also specify the tag as an extra argument to `commit`:

```bash
$ docker commit <containerId> figlet
```

And then run it using its tag:

```bash
$ docker run -it figlet
```

## What's next?

Manual process = bad.

Automated process = good.

In the next chapter, we will learn how to automate the build
process by writing a `Dockerfile`.

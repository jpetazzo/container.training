## Wait, what, 17.12 ?!?

--

- Docker 1.13 = Docker 17.03 (year.month, like Ubuntu)

- Every month, there is a new "edge" release (with new features)

- Every quarter, there is a new "stable" release

- Docker CE releases are maintained 4+ months

- Docker EE releases are maintained 12+ months

- For more details, check the [Docker EE announcement blog post](https://blog.docker.com/2017/03/docker-enterprise-edition/)

## Docker CE vs Docker EE

- Docker EE:

  - $$$
  - certification for select distros, clouds, and plugins
  - advanced management features (fine-grained access control, security scanning...)

- Docker CE:

  - free
  - available through Docker Mac, Docker Windows, and major Linux distros
  - perfect for individuals and small organizations

---

class: extra-details

## Why?

- More readable for enterprise users

  (i.e. the very nice folks who are kind enough to pay us big $$$ for our stuff)

- No impact for the community

  (beyond CE/EE suffix and version numbering change)

- Both trains leverage the same open source components

  (containerd, libcontainer, SwarmKit...)

- More predictible release schedule (see next slide)

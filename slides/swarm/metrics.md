# Metrics collection

- We want to gather metrics in a central place

- We will gather node metrics and container metrics

- We want a nice interface to view them (graphs)

---

## Node metrics

- CPU, RAM, disk usage on the whole node

- Total number of processes running, and their states

- Number of open files, sockets, and their states

- I/O activity (disk, network), per operation or volume

- Physical/hardware (when applicable): temperature, fan speed ...

- ... and much more!

---

## Container metrics

- Similar to node metrics, but not totally identical

- RAM breakdown will be different

  - active vs inactive memory
  - some memory is *shared* between containers, and accounted specially

- I/O activity is also harder to track

  - async writes can cause deferred "charges"
  - some page-ins are also shared between containers

For details about container metrics, see:
<br/>
http://jpetazzo.github.io/2013/10/08/docker-containers-metrics/

---

## Application metrics

- Arbitrary metrics related to your application and business

- System performance: request latency, error rate ...

- Volume information: number of rows in database, message queue size ...

- Business data: inventory, items sold, revenue ...

---

class: snap, prom

## Tools

We will build *two* different metrics pipelines:

- One based on Intel Snap,

- Another based on Prometheus.

If you're using Play-With-Docker, skip the exercises
relevant to Intel Snap (we rely on a SSH server to deploy,
and PWD doesn't have that yet).

---

class: snap

## First metrics pipeline

We will use three open source Go projects for our first metrics pipeline:

- Intel Snap

  Collects, processes, and publishes metrics

- InfluxDB

  Stores metrics

- Grafana

  Displays metrics visually

---

class: snap

## Snap

- [github.com/intelsdi-x/snap](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap)

- Can collect, process, and publish metric data

- Doesn’t store metrics

- Works as a daemon (snapd) controlled by a CLI (snapctl)

- Offloads collecting, processing, and publishing to plugins

- Does nothing out of the box; configuration required!

- Docs: https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/

---

class: snap

## InfluxDB

- Snap doesn't store metrics data

- InfluxDB is specifically designed for time-series data

  - CRud vs. CRUD (you rarely if ever update/delete data)

  - orthogonal read and write patterns

  - storage format optimization is key (for disk usage and performance)

- Snap has a plugin allowing to *publish* to InfluxDB

---

class: snap

## Grafana

- Snap cannot show graphs

- InfluxDB cannot show graphs

- Grafana will take care of that

- Grafana can read data from InfluxDB and display it as graphs

---

class: snap

## Getting and setting up Snap

- We will install Snap directly on the nodes

- Release tarballs are available from GitHub

- We will use a *global service*
  <br/>(started on all nodes, including nodes added later)

- This service will download and unpack Snap in /opt and /usr/local

- /opt and /usr/local will be bind-mounted from the host

- This service will effectively install Snap on the hosts

---

class: snap

## The Snap installer service

- This will get Snap on all nodes

.exercise[

```bash
docker service create --restart-condition=none --mode global \
       --mount type=bind,source=/usr/local/bin,target=/usr/local/bin \
       --mount type=bind,source=/opt,target=/opt centos sh -c '
SNAPVER=v0.16.1-beta
RELEASEURL=https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/releases/download/$SNAPVER
curl -sSL $RELEASEURL/snap-$SNAPVER-linux-amd64.tar.gz |
     tar -C /opt -zxf-
curl -sSL $RELEASEURL/snap-plugins-$SNAPVER-linux-amd64.tar.gz |
     tar -C /opt -zxf-
ln -s snap-$SNAPVER /opt/snap
for BIN in snapd snapctl; do ln -s /opt/snap/bin/$BIN /usr/local/bin/$BIN; done
' # If you copy-paste that block, do not forget that final quote ☺
```

]

---

class: snap

## First contact with `snapd`

- The core of Snap is `snapd`, the Snap daemon

- Application made up of a REST API, control module, and scheduler module

.exercise[

- Start `snapd` with plugin trust disabled and log level set to debug:
  ```bash
  snapd -t 0 -l 1
  ```

]

- More resources:

  https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/SNAPD.md
  https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/SNAPD_CONFIGURATION.md

---

class: snap

## Using `snapctl` to interact with `snapd`

- Let's load a *collector* and a *publisher* plugins

.exercise[

- Open a new terminal

- Load the psutil collector plugin:
  ```bash
  snapctl plugin load /opt/snap/plugin/snap-plugin-collector-psutil
  ```

- Load the file publisher plugin:
  ```bash
  snapctl plugin load /opt/snap/plugin/snap-plugin-publisher-mock-file
  ```

]

---

class: snap

## Checking what we've done

- Good to know: Docker CLI uses `ls`, Snap CLI uses `list`

.exercise[

- See your loaded plugins:
  ```bash
  snapctl plugin list
  ```

- See the metrics you can collect:
  ```bash
  snapctl metric list
  ```

]

---

class: snap

## Actually collecting metrics: introducing *tasks*

- To start collecting/processing/publishing metric data, you need to create a *task*

- A *task* indicates:

  - *what* to collect (which metrics)
  - *when* to collect it (e.g. how often)
  - *how* to process it (e.g. use it directly, or compute moving averages)
  - *where* to publish it

- Tasks can be defined with manifests written in JSON or YAML

- Some plugins, such as the Docker collector, allow for wildcards (\*) in the metrics "path"
  <br/>(see snap/docker-influxdb.json)

- More resources:
  https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/TASKS.md

---

class: snap

## Our first task manifest

```yaml
  version: 1
  schedule:
    type: "simple" # collect on a set interval
    interval: "1s" # of every 1s
  max-failures: 10
  workflow:
    collect: # first collect
      metrics: # metrics to collect
        /intel/psutil/load/load1: {}
      config: # there is no configuration
      publish: # after collecting, publish
        -
            plugin_name: "file" # use the file publisher
            config:
                file: "/tmp/snap-psutil-file.log" # write to this file
```

---

class: snap

## Creating our first task

- The task manifest shown on the previous slide is stored in `snap/psutil-file.yml`.

.exercise[

- Create a task using the manifest:

  ```bash
  cd ~/container.training/snap
  snapctl task create -t psutil-file.yml
  ```

]

  The output should look like the following:
  ```
    Using task manifest to create task
    Task created
    ID: 240435e8-a250-4782-80d0-6fff541facba
    Name: Task-240435e8-a250-4782-80d0-6fff541facba
    State: Running
  ```

---

class: snap

## Checking existing tasks

.exercise[

- This will confirm that our task is running correctly, and remind us of its task ID

  ```bash
  snapctl task list
  ```

]

The output should look like the following:
  ```
    ID           NAME              STATE     HIT MISS FAIL CREATED
    24043...acba Task-24043...acba Running   4   0    0    2:34PM   8-13-2016
  ```
---

class: snap

## Viewing our task dollars at work

- The task is using a very simple publisher, `mock-file`

- That publisher just writes text lines in a file (one line per data point)

.exercise[

- Check that the data is flowing indeed:
  ```bash
  tail -f /tmp/snap-psutil-file.log
  ```

]

To exit, hit `^C`

---

class: snap

## Debugging tasks

- When a task is not directly writing to a local file, use `snapctl task watch`

- `snapctl task watch` will stream the metrics you are collecting to STDOUT

.exercise[

```bash
snapctl task watch <ID>
```

]

To exit, hit `^C`

---

class: snap

## Stopping snap

- Our Snap deployment has a few flaws:

  - snapd was started manually

  - it is running on a single node

  - the configuration is purely local

--

class: snap

- We want to change that!

--

class: snap

- But first, go back to the terminal where `snapd` is running, and hit `^C`

- All tasks will be stopped; all plugins will be unloaded; Snap will exit

---

class: snap

## Snap Tribe Mode

- Tribe is Snap's clustering mechanism

- When tribe mode is enabled, nodes can join *agreements*

- When a node in an *agreement* does something (e.g. load a plugin or run a task),
  <br/>other nodes of that agreement do the same thing

- We will use it to load the Docker collector and InfluxDB publisher on all nodes,
  <br/>and run a task to use them

- Without tribe mode, we would have to load plugins and run tasks manually on every node

- More resources:
  https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/TRIBE.md

---

class: snap

## Running Snap itself on every node

- Snap runs in the foreground, so you need to use `&` or start it in tmux

.exercise[

- Run the following command *on every node:*
  ```bash
  snapd -t 0 -l 1 --tribe --tribe-seed node1:6000
  ```

]

If you're *not* using Play-With-Docker, there is another way to start Snap!

---

class: snap

## Starting a daemon through SSH

.warning[Hackety hack ahead!]

- We will create a *global service*

- That global service will install a SSH client

- With that SSH client, the service will connect back to its local node
  <br/>(i.e. "break out" of the container, using the SSH key that we provide)

- Once logged on the node, the service starts snapd with Tribe Mode enabled

---

class: snap

## Running Snap itself on every node

- I might go to hell for showing you this, but here it goes ...

.exercise[

- Start Snap all over the place:
  ```bash
    docker service create --name snapd --mode global \
           --mount type=bind,source=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa,target=/sshkey \
           alpine sh -c "
                  apk add --no-cache openssh-client &&
                  ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i /sshkey docker@172.17.0.1 \
                      sudo snapd -t 0 -l 1 --tribe --tribe-seed node1:6000
           " # If you copy-paste that block, don't forget that final quote :-)
   ```

]

Remember: this *does not work* with Play-With-Docker (which doesn't have SSH).

---

class: snap

## Viewing the members of our tribe

- If everything went fine, Snap is now running in tribe mode

.exercise[

- View the members of our tribe:
  ```bash
  snapctl member list
  ```

]

This should show the 5 nodes with their hostnames.

---

class: snap

## Create an agreement

- We can now create an *agreement* for our plugins and tasks

.exercise[

- Create an agreement; make sure to use the same name all along:
  ```bash
  snapctl agreement create docker-influxdb
  ```

]

The output should look like the following:

```
  Name             Number of Members       plugins      tasks
  docker-influxdb  0                       0            0
```

---

class: snap

## Instruct all nodes to join the agreement

- We don't need another fancy global service!

- We can join nodes from any existing node of the cluster

.exercise[

- Add all nodes to the agreement:
  ```bash
    snapctl member list | tail -n +2 |
      xargs -n1 snapctl agreement join docker-influxdb
  ```

]

The last bit of output should look like the following:
```
  Name             Number of Members       plugins         tasks
  docker-influxdb  5                       0               0
```

---

class: snap

## Start a container on every node

- The Docker plugin requires at least one container to be started

- Normally, at this point, you will have at least one container on each node

- But just in case you did things differently, let's create a dummy global service

.exercise[

- Create an alpine container on the whole cluster:
  ```bash
    docker service create --name ping --mode global alpine ping 8.8.8.8
  ```

]

---

class: snap

## Running InfluxDB

- We will create a service for InfluxDB

- We will use the official image

- InfluxDB uses multiple ports:

  - 8086 (HTTP API; we need this)

  - 8083 (admin interface; we need this)

  - 8088 (cluster communication; not needed here)

  - more ports for other protocols (graphite, collectd...)

- We will just publish the first two

---

class: snap

## Creating the InfluxDB service

.exercise[

- Start an InfluxDB service, publishing ports 8083 and 8086:
  ```bash
    docker service create --name influxdb \
           --publish 8083:8083 \
           --publish 8086:8086 \
           influxdb:0.13
  ```

]

Note: this will allow any node to publish metrics data to `localhost:8086`,
and it will allows us to access the admin interface by connecting to any node
on port 8083.

.warning[Make sure to use InfluxDB 0.13; a few things changed in 1.0
(like, the name of the default retention policy is now "autogen") and
this breaks a few things.]

---

class: snap

## Setting up InfluxDB

- We need to create the "snap" database

.exercise[

- Open port 8083 with your browser

- Enter the following query in the query box:
  ```
  CREATE DATABASE "snap"
  ```

- In the top-right corner, select "Database: snap"

]

Note: the InfluxDB query language *looks like* SQL but it's not.

???

## Setting a retention policy

- When graduating to 1.0, InfluxDB changed the name of the default policy

- It used to be "default" and it is now "autogen"

- Snap still uses "default" and this results in errors

.exercise[

- Create a "default" retention policy by entering the following query in the box:
  ```
  CREATE RETENTION POLICY "default" ON "snap" DURATION 1w REPLICATION 1
  ```

]

---

class: snap

## Load Docker collector and InfluxDB publisher

- We will load plugins on the local node

- Since our local node is a member of the agreement, all other
  nodes in the agreement will also load these plugins

.exercise[

- Load Docker collector:

  ```bash
  snapctl plugin load /opt/snap/plugin/snap-plugin-collector-docker
  ```

- Load InfluxDB publisher:

  ```bash
  snapctl plugin load /opt/snap/plugin/snap-plugin-publisher-influxdb
  ```

]

---

class: snap

## Start a simple collection task

- Again, we will create a task on the local node

- The task will be replicated on other nodes members of the same agreement

.exercise[

- Load a task manifest file collecting a couple of metrics on all containers,
  <br/>and sending them to InfluxDB:
  ```bash
  cd ~/container.training/snap
  snapctl task create -t docker-influxdb.json
  ```

]

Note: the task description sends metrics to the InfluxDB API endpoint
located at 127.0.0.1:8086. Since the InfluxDB container is published
on port 8086, 127.0.0.1:8086 always routes traffic to the InfluxDB
container.

---

class: snap

## If things go wrong...

Note: if a task runs into a problem (e.g. it's trying to publish
to a metrics database, but the database is unreachable), the task
will be stopped.

You will have to restart it manually by running:

```bash
snapctl task enable <ID>
snapctl task start <ID>
```

This must be done *per node*. Alternatively, you can delete+re-create
the task (it will delete+re-create on all nodes).

---

class: snap

## Check that metric data shows up in InfluxDB

- Let's check existing data with a few manual queries in the InfluxDB admin interface

.exercise[

- List "measurements":
  ```
  SHOW MEASUREMENTS
  ```
  (This should show two generic entries corresponding to the two collected metrics.)

- View time series data for one of the metrics:
  ```
  SELECT * FROM "intel/docker/stats/cgroups/cpu_stats/cpu_usage/total_usage"
  ```
  (This should show a list of data points with **time**, **docker_id**, **source**, and **value**.)

]

---

class: snap

## Deploy Grafana

- We will use an almost-official image, `grafana/grafana`

- We will publish Grafana's web interface on its default port (3000)

.exercise[

- Create the Grafana service:
  ```bash
  docker service create --name grafana --publish 3000:3000 grafana/grafana:3.1.1
  ```

]

---

class: snap

## Set up Grafana

.exercise[

- Open port 3000 with your browser

- Identify with "admin" as the username and password

- Click on the Grafana logo (the orange spiral in the top left corner)

- Click on "Data Sources"

- Click on "Add data source" (green button on the right)

]

---

class: snap

## Add InfluxDB as a data source for Grafana

.small[

Fill the form exactly as follows:
- Name = "snap"
- Type = "InfluxDB"

In HTTP settings, fill as follows:
- Url = "http://(IP.address.of.any.node):8086"
- Access = "direct"
- Leave HTTP Auth untouched

In InfluxDB details, fill as follows:
- Database = "snap"
- Leave user and password blank

Finally, click on "add", you should see a green message saying "Success - Data source is working".
If you see an orange box (sometimes without a message), it means that you got something wrong. Triple check everything again.

]

---

class: snap

![Screenshot showing how to fill the form](images/grafana-add-source.png)

---

class: snap

## Create a dashboard in Grafana

.exercise[

- Click on the Grafana logo again (the orange spiral in the top left corner)

- Hover over "Dashboards"

- Click "+ New"

- Click on the little green rectangle that appeared in the top left

- Hover over "Add Panel"

- Click on "Graph"

]

At this point, you should see a sample graph showing up.

---

class: snap

## Setting up a graph in Grafana

.exercise[

- Panel data source: select snap
- Click on the SELECT metrics query to expand it
- Click on "select measurement" and pick CPU usage
- Click on the "+" right next to "WHERE"
- Select "docker_id"
- Select the ID of a container of your choice (e.g. the one running InfluxDB)
- Click on the "+" on the right of the "SELECT" line
- Add "derivative"
- In the "derivative" option, select "1s"
- In the top right corner, click on the clock, and pick "last 5 minutes"

]

Congratulations, you are viewing the CPU usage of a single container!

---

class: snap

![Screenshot showing the end result](images/grafana-add-graph.png)

---

class: snap, prom

## Before moving on ...

- Leave that tab open!

- We are going to set up *another* metrics system

- ... And then compare both graphs side by side

---

class: snap, prom

## Prometheus vs. Snap

- Prometheus is another metrics collection system

- Snap *pushes* metrics; Prometheus *pulls* them

---

class: prom

## Prometheus components

- The *Prometheus server* pulls, stores, and displays metrics

- Its configuration defines a list of *exporter* endpoints
  <br/>(that list can be dynamic, using e.g. Consul, DNS, Etcd...)

- The exporters expose metrics over HTTP using a simple line-oriented format

  (An optimized format using protobuf is also possible)

---

class: prom

## It's all about the `/metrics`

- This is what the *node exporter* looks like:

  http://demo.robustperception.io:9100/metrics

- Prometheus itself exposes its own internal metrics, too:

  http://demo.robustperception.io:9090/metrics

- A *Prometheus server* will *scrape* URLs like these

  (It can also use protobuf to avoid the overhead of parsing line-oriented formats!)

---

class: prom-manual

## Collecting metrics with Prometheus on Swarm

- We will run two *global services* (i.e. scheduled on all our nodes):

  - the Prometheus *node exporter* to get node metrics

  - Google's cAdvisor to get container metrics

- We will run a Prometheus server to scrape these exporters

- The Prometheus server will be configured to use DNS service discovery

- We will use `tasks.<servicename>` for service discovery

- All these services will be placed on a private internal network

---

class: prom-manual

## Creating an overlay network for Prometheus

- This is the easiest step ☺

.exercise[

- Create an overlay network:
  ```bash
  docker network create --driver overlay prom
  ```

]

---

class: prom-manual

## Running the node exporter

- The node exporter *should* run directly on the hosts
- However, it can run from a container, if configured properly
  <br/>
  (it needs to access the host's filesystems, in particular /proc and /sys)

.exercise[

- Start the node exporter:
  ```bash
    docker service create --name node --mode global --network prom \
     --mount type=bind,source=/proc,target=/host/proc \
     --mount type=bind,source=/sys,target=/host/sys \
     --mount type=bind,source=/,target=/rootfs \
     prom/node-exporter \
      --path.procfs /host/proc \
      --path.sysfs /host/proc \
      --collector.filesystem.ignored-mount-points "^/(sys|proc|dev|host|etc)($|/)"
   ```

]

---

class: prom-manual

## Running cAdvisor

- Likewise, cAdvisor *should* run directly on the hosts

- But it can run in containers, if configured properly

.exercise[

- Start the cAdvisor collector:
  ```bash
    docker service create --name cadvisor --network prom --mode global \
      --mount type=bind,source=/,target=/rootfs \
      --mount type=bind,source=/var/run,target=/var/run \
      --mount type=bind,source=/sys,target=/sys \
      --mount type=bind,source=/var/lib/docker,target=/var/lib/docker \
      google/cadvisor:latest
  ```

]

---

class: prom-manual

## Prometheus server configuration

This will be our configuration file for Prometheus:

.small[
```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 10s
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
  - job_name: 'node'
    dns_sd_configs:
      - names: ['tasks.node']
        type: 'A'
        port: 9100
  - job_name: 'cadvisor'
    dns_sd_configs:
      - names: ['tasks.cadvisor']
        type: 'A'
        port: 8080
```
]

---

class: prom-manual

## Passing the configuration to Prometheus

- The easiest solution is to create a custom image bundling this configuration

- We will use a very simple Dockerfile:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM prom/prometheus:v1.4.1
  COPY prometheus.yml /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
  ```

  (The configuration file, and the Dockerfile, are in the `prom` subdirectory)

- We will build this image, and push it to our local registry

- Then we will create a service using this image

Note: it is also possible to use a `config` to inject that configuration file
without having to create this ad-hoc image.

---

class: prom-manual

## Building our custom Prometheus image

- We will use the local registry started previously on 127.0.0.1:5000

.exercise[

- Build the image using the provided Dockerfile:
  ```bash
  docker build -t 127.0.0.1:5000/prometheus ~/container.training/prom
  ```

- Push the image to our local registry:
  ```bash
  docker push 127.0.0.1:5000/prometheus
  ```

]

---

class: prom-manual

## Running our custom Prometheus image

- That's the only service that needs to be published

  (If we want to access Prometheus from outside!)

.exercise[

- Start the Prometheus server:
  ```bash
    docker service create --network prom --name prom \
           --publish 9090:9090 127.0.0.1:5000/prometheus
  ```

]

---

class: prom-auto

## Deploying Prometheus on our cluster

- We will use a stack definition (once again)

.exercise[

- Make sure we are in the stacks directory:
  ```bash
  cd ~/container.training/stacks
  ```

- Build, ship, and run the Prometheus stack:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f prometheus.yml build
  docker-compose -f prometheus.yml push
  docker stack deploy -c prometheus.yml prometheus
  ```

]

---

class: prom

## Checking our Prometheus server

- First, let's make sure that Prometheus is correctly scraping all metrics

.exercise[

- Open port 9090 with your browser

- Click on "status", then "targets"

]

You should see 7 endpoints (3 cadvisor, 3 node, 1 prometheus).

Their state should be "UP".

---

class: prom-auto, config

## Injecting a configuration file

(New in Docker Engine 17.06)

- We are creating a custom image *just to inject a configuration*

- Instead, we could use the base Prometheus image + a `config` 

- A `config` is a blob (usually, a configuration file) that:

  - is created and managed through the Docker API (and CLI)

  - gets persisted into the Raft log (i.e. safely)

  - can be associated to a service
    <br/>
    (this injects the blob as a plain file in the service's containers)

---

class: prom-auto, config

## Differences between `config` and `secret`

The two are very similar, but ...

- `configs`:

  - can be injected to any filesystem location

  - can be viewed and extracted using the Docker API or CLI

- `secrets`:

  - can only be injected into `/run/secrets`

  - are never stored in clear text on disk

  - cannot be viewed or extracted with the Docker API or CLI

---

class: prom-auto, config

## Deploying Prometheus with a `config`

The following Compose file (`prometheus+config.yml`) achieves
the same result, but by using a `config` instead of baking the
configuration into the image.

.small[
```yaml
version: "3.3"

services:

prometheus:
  image: prom/prometheus:v1.4.1 
  ports:
    - "9090:9090"

## Specifying a `config` in a Compose file

- In each service, an optional `configs` section can list as many configs as you want

- Each config can specify:

  - an optional `target` (path to inject the configuration; by default: root of the container)

  - ownership and permissions (by default, the file will be owned by UID 0, i.e. `root`)

- These configs reference top-level `configs` elements

- The top-level configs can be declared as:

  - *external*, meaning that it is supposed to be created before you deploy the stack

  - referencing a file, whose content is used to initialize the config

---

class: prom-auto, config

## Re-deploying Prometheus with a config

- We will update the existing stack using `prometheus+config.yml`

.exercise[

- Redeploy the `prometheus` stack:
  ```bash
  docker stack deploy -c prometheus+config.yml prometheus
  ```

- Check that Prometheus still works as intended

  (By connecting to any node of the cluster, on port 9090)

]

---

class: prom-auto, config

## Accessing the config object from the CLI

- Config objects can be viewed from the Docker CLI (or API)

.exercise[

- List existing config objects:
  ```bash
  docker config ls
  ```

- View details about our config object:
  ```bash
  docker config inspect prometheus_prometheus
  ```

]

Note: the content of the config blob is shown with BASE64 encoding.
<br/>
(It doesn't have to be text; it could be an image or any kind of binary content!)

---

class: prom-auto, config

## Extracting a config blob

- Let's retrieve that Prometheus configuration!

.exercise[

- Extract the BASE64 payload with `jq`:
  ```bash
  docker config inspect prometheus_prometheus | jq -r .[0].Spec.Data
  ```

- Decode it with `base64 -d`:
  ```bash
  docker config inspect prometheus_prometheus | jq -r .[0].Spec.Data | base64 -d
  ```

## Displaying metrics directly from Prometheus

- This is easy ... if you are familiar with PromQL

.exercise[

- Click on "Graph", and in "expression", paste the following:
  ```
    sum by (container_label_com_docker_swarm_node_id) (
      irate(
        container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{
          container_label_com_docker_swarm_service_name="dockercoins_worker"
          }[1m]
      )
    )
  ```

- Click on the blue "Execute" button and on the "Graph" tab just below

]

---

class: prom

## Building the query from scratch

- We are going to build the same query from scratch

- This doesn't intend to be a detailed PromQL course

- This is merely so that you (I) can pretend to know how the previous query works
  <br/>so that your coworkers (you) can be suitably impressed (or not)

  (Or, so that we can build other queries if necessary, or adapt if cAdvisor,
  Prometheus, or anything else changes and requires editing the query!)

---

class: prom

## Displaying a raw metric for *all* containers

- Click on the "Graph" tab on top

  *This takes us to a blank dashboard*

- Click on the "Insert metric at cursor" drop down, and select `container_cpu_usage_seconds_total`

  *This puts the metric name in the query box*

- Click on "Execute"

  *This fills a table of measurements below*

- Click on "Graph" (next to "Console")

  *This replaces the table of measurements with a series of graphs (after a few seconds)*

---

class: prom

## Selecting metrics for a specific service

- Hover over the lines in the graph

  (Look for the ones that have labels like `container_label_com_docker_...`)

- Edit the query, adding a condition between curly braces:

  .small[`container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container_label_com_docker_swarm_service_name="dockercoins_worker"}`]

- Click on "Execute"

  *Now we should see one line per CPU per container*

- If you want to select by container ID, you can use a regex match: `id=~"/docker/c4bf.*"`

- You can also specify multiple conditions by separating them with commas

---

class: prom

## Turn counters into rates

- What we see is the total amount of CPU used (in seconds)

- We want to see a *rate* (CPU time used / real time)

- To get a moving average over 1 minute periods, enclose the current expression within:

  ```
  rate ( ... { ... } [1m] )
  ```

  *This should turn our steadily-increasing CPU counter into a wavy graph*

- To get an instantaneous rate, use `irate` instead of `rate`

  (The time window is then used to limit how far behind to look for data if data points
  are missing in case of scrape failure; see [here](https://www.robustperception.io/irate-graphs-are-better-graphs/) for more details!)

  *This should show spikes that were previously invisible because they were smoothed out*

---

class: prom

## Aggregate multiple data series

- We have one graph per CPU per container; we want to sum them

- Enclose the whole expression within:

  ```
  sum ( ... )
  ```

  *We now see a single graph*

---

class: prom

## Collapse dimensions

- If we have multiple containers we can also collapse just the CPU dimension:

  ```
  sum without (cpu) ( ... )
  ```

  *This shows the same graph, but preserves the other labels*

- Congratulations, you wrote your first PromQL expression from scratch!

  (I'd like to thank [Johannes Ziemke](https://twitter.com/discordianfish) and
  [Julius Volz](https://twitter.com/juliusvolz) for their help with Prometheus!)

## Comparing Snap and Prometheus data

- If you haven't set up Snap, InfluxDB, and Grafana, skip this section

- If you have closed the Grafana tab, you might have to re-set up a new dashboard

  (Unless you saved it before navigating it away)

- To re-do the setup, just follow again the instructions from the previous chapter

---

class: prom, snap

## Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana

.exercise[

- In a new tab, connect to Grafana (port 3000)

- Click on the Grafana logo (the orange spiral in the top-left corner)

- Click on "Data Sources"

- Click on the green "Add data source" button

]

We see the same input form that we filled earlier to connect to InfluxDB.

---

class: prom, snap

## Connecting to Prometheus from Grafana

.exercise[

- Enter "prom" in the name field

- Select "Prometheus" as the source type

- Enter http://(IP.address.of.any.node):9090 in the Url field

- Select "direct" as the access method

- Click on "Save and test"

]

Again, we should see a green box telling us "Data source is working."

Otherwise, double-check every field and try again!

---

class: prom, snap

## Adding the Prometheus data to our dashboard

.exercise[

- Go back to the the tab where we had our first Grafana dashboard

- Click on the blue "Add row" button in the lower right corner

- Click on the green tab on the left; select "Add panel" and "Graph"

]

This takes us to the graph editor that we used earlier.

---

class: prom, snap

## Querying Prometheus data from Grafana

The editor is a bit less friendly than the one we used for InfluxDB.

.exercise[

- Select "prom" as Panel data source

- Paste the query in the query field:
  ```
    sum without (cpu, id) ( irate (
      container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{
        container_label_com_docker_swarm_service_name="influxdb"}[1m] ) )
  ```

- Click outside of the query field to confirm

- Close the row editor by clicking the "X" in the top right area

]

---

class: prom, snap

## Interpreting results

- The two graphs *should* be similar

- Protip: align the time references!

.exercise[

- Click on the clock in the top right corner

- Select "last 30 minutes"

- Click on "Zoom out"

- Now press the right arrow key (hold it down and watch the CPU usage increase!)

]

*Adjusting units is left as an exercise for the reader.*

    # Overview for today

    - We'll learn how to install Helm charts

    - We'll install Prometheus+Grafana
      <br/>(so that se start collecting metrics for later)

    - We'll install an ingress controller and cert-manager

    - We'll use that to deploy a private Harbor registry

    - We'll use that registry to store private Dockercoins images

    - We'll deploy Dockercoins with these images

    - Finally we'll go back to the metrics to see what has been collected!

    # Exercise — Harbor

    - Deploy an ingress controller

    - Deploy cert-manager

    - Configure it with Let's Encrypt

    - Deploy Harbor

    - Create a "dockercoins" project in Harbor

    - Fork https://github.com/jpetazzo/dockercoins

    - Configure GitHub Actions to automatically push images to Harbor

    - Deploy DockerCoins using the images hosted on Harbor

    # Exercise — ArgoCD

    - Deploy ArgoCD

    - Set up ArgoCD to deploy DockerCoins with a plain YAML manifest
      <br/>
      (e.g. copy [that manifest][dockercoins-yaml] to a repo of your own)

    - Set up ArgoCD to deploy DockerCoins with a basic Helm chart
      <br/>
      (e.g. just put the YAML manifest in the `templates` directory)

    - Set up ArgoCD to deploy DockerCoins with a generic chart
      <br/>
      (=deploy the same chart 5 times but with different values)

    - Set up ArgoCD to deploy DockerCoins using the images on Harbor

    - Confirm that you can make changes to the DockerCoins code and deploy them

    - Bonus: how to automatically roll out new images?

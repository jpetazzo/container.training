# T02- creating **_‚öóÔ∏èTEST_** env on our **_‚òÅÔ∏èCLOUDY_** cluster

Let's take a look at our **_‚òÅÔ∏èCLOUDY_** cluster!

**_‚òÅÔ∏èCLOUDY_** is a Kubernetes cluster created with [Scaleway Kapsule](https://www.scaleway.com/en/kubernetes-kapsule/) managed service

This managed cluster comes preinstalled with specific features:
- Kubernetes dashboard
- specific _Storage Classes_ based on Scaleway _IaaS_ block storage offerings
- a `Cilium` _CNI_ stack already set up

---

## Accessing the managed Kubernetes cluster

To access our cluster, we'll connect via [`shpod`](https://github.com/jpetazzo/shpod)

.lab[

- If you already have a kubectl on your desktop computer
```bash
kubectl run shpod --image=jpetazzo/shpod --overrides='{ "spec": { "serviceAccountName": "" } }'
```
- or directly via ssh (see: https://github.com/jpetazzo/shpod)
```bash
ssh -p myPort k8s@myShpodSvcIpAddress
```

]

---

## Flux installation

Once `Flux` is installed,  
the **_‚öôÔ∏èOPS_** team exclusively operates its clusters by updating a code base in a `Github` repository

_GitOps_ and `Flux` enable the **_‚öôÔ∏èOPS_** team to rely on the _first-class citizen pattern_ in Kubernetes' world through these steps:

- describe the **desired target state**
- and let the **automated convergence** happens

---

### Checking prerequisites

The `Flux` _CLI_ is available in our `shpod` pod

Before installation, we need to check that:
   - `Flux` _CLI_ is correctly installed
   - it can connect to the `API server`
   - our versions of `Flux` and Kubernetes are compatible

.lab[

```bash
k8s@shpod:~$ flux --version
flux version 2.5.1

k8s@shpod:~$ flux check --pre
‚ñ∫ checking prerequisites
‚úî Kubernetes 1.32.3 >=1.30.0-0
‚úî prerequisites checks passed
```

]

---

### Git repository for Flux configuration

The **_‚öôÔ∏èOPS_** team uses `Flux` _CLI_
- to create a `git` repository named `fleet-config-using-flux-XXXXX` (‚ö† replace `XXXXX` by a personnal suffix)
- in our `Github` organization named `container-training-fleet`

Prerequisites are:
  - `Flux` _CLI_ needs a `Github` personal access token (_PAT_)
      - to create and/or access the `Github` repository
      - to give permissions to existing teams in our `Github` organization
  - The PAT needs _CRUD_ permissions on our `Github` organization
    - repositories
    - admin:public_key
    - users

- As **_‚öôÔ∏èOPS_** team, let's creates a `Github` personal access token‚Ä¶

### Creating dedicated `Github` repo to host Flux config

.lab[

- let's replace the `GITHUB_TOKEN` value by our _Personal Access Token_
- and the `GITHUB_REPO` value by our specific repository name

```bash
k8s@shpod:~$ export GITHUB_TOKEN="my-token" &&         \
      export GITHUB_USER="container-training-fleet" && \
      export GITHUB_REPO="fleet-config-using-flux-XXXXX"

k8s@shpod:~$ flux bootstrap github \
      --owner=${GITHUB_USER}       \
      --repository=${GITHUB_REPO}  \
      --team=OPS                   \
      --team=ROCKY --team=MOVY     \
      --path=clusters/CLOUDY
```

### Flux configures Github repository access for teams

- `Flux` sets up permissions that allow teams within our organization to **access** the `Github` repository as maintainers
- Teams need to exist before `Flux` proceeds to this configuration

![Teams in Github](images/M6-github-teams.png)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

- In this lab, adding these teams as maintainers was merely a demonstration of how `Flux` _CLI_ sets up permissions in Github

- But there is no need for dev teams to have access to this `Github` repository

- One advantage of _GitOps_ lies in its ability to easily set up üí™üèº **Separation of concerns** by using multiple `Flux` sources

---

### üìÇ Flux config files

`Flux` has been successfully installed onto our **_‚òÅÔ∏èCLOUDY_** Kubernetes cluster!

Its configuration is managed through a _Gitops_ workflow sourced directly from our `Github` repository

Let's review our `Flux` configuration files we've created and pushed into the `Github` repository‚Ä¶  
‚Ä¶ as well as the corresponding components running in our Kubernetes cluster

### Flux components

- the `source controller` monitors `Git` repositories to apply Kubernetes resources on the cluster

- the `Helm controller` checks for new `Helm` _charts_ releases in `Helm` repositories and installs updates as needed

- _CRDs_ store `Flux` configuration within the Kubernetes control plane

### Flux CLI

`Flux` Command-Line Interface fulfills 3 primary functions:

1. It installs and configures first mandatory `Flux` resources in a _Gitops_ `git` repository
  - ensuring proper access and permissions

2. It locally generates `YAML` files for desired `Flux` resources so that we just need to `git push` them
  - tenants
  - sources
  - ‚Ä¶

3. It requests the API server to manage `Flux`-related resources
     - _operators_
     - _CRDs_
     - logs

---

### üîç Flux -- for more info

Please, refer to the [`Flux` chapter in the High Five M3 module](./3.yml.html#toc-helm-chart-format)

---

### Flux relies on Kustomize

The `Flux` component named `kustomize controller` look for `Kustomize` resources in `Flux` code-based sources

1. `Kustomize` look for `YAML` manifests listed in the `kustomization.yaml` file

2. and aggregates, hydrates and patches them following the `kustomization` configuration

---

class: extra-details

### 2 different kustomization resources

‚ö†Ô∏è `Flux` uses 2 distinct resources with `kind: kustomization`

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: kustomization
```

describes how Kustomize (the _CLI_ tool) appends and transforms `YAML` manifests into a single bunch of `YAML` described resources

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1 group
kind: Kustomization
```

describes where `Flux kustomize-controller` looks for a `kustomization.yaml` file in a given `Flux` code-based source

---

### üîç Kustomize -- for more info

Please, refer to the [`Kustomize` chapter in the High Five M3 module](./3.yml.html#toc-kustomize)

---

### üîç Group / Version / Kind -- for more info

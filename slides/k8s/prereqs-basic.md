## Pre-requirements

- Be comfortable with the UNIX command line

  - navigating directories

  - editing files

  - a little bit of bash-fu (environment variables, loops)

- Hands-on experience working with containers

  - building images, running them; doesn't matter how exactly

  - if you know `docker run`, `docker build`, `docker ps`, you're good to go!

- It's totally OK if you are not a Docker expert!

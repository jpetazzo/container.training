# Executing batch jobs

- Deployments are great for stateless web apps

  (as well as workers that keep running forever)

- Pods are great for one-off execution that we don't care about

  (because they don't get automatically restarted if something goes wrong)

- Jobs are great for "long" background work

  ("long" being at least minutes our hours)

- CronJobs are great to schedule Jobs at regular intervals

  (just like the classic UNIX `cron` daemon with its `crontab` files)

---

## Creating a Job

- A Job will create a Pod

- If the Pod fails, the Job will create another one

- The Job will keep trying until:

  - either a Pod succeeds,

  - or we hit the *backoff limit* of the Job (default=6)

.exercise[

- Create a Job that has a 50% chance of success:
  ```bash
    kubectl create job flipcoin --image=alpine -- sh -c 'exit $(($RANDOM%2))' 
  ```

]

---

## Our Job in action

- Our Job will create a Pod named `flipcoin-xxxxx`

- If the Pod succeeds, the Job stops

- If the Pod fails, the Job creates another Pod

.exercise[

- Check the status of the Pod(s) created by the Job:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --selector=job-name=flipcoin
  ```

]

## More advanced jobs

- We can specify a number of "completions" (default=1)

- This indicates how many times the Job must be executed

- We can specify the "parallelism" (default=1)

- This indicates how many Pods should be running in parallel

- These options cannot be specified with `kubectl create job`

  (we have to write our own YAML manifest to use them)

---

## Scheduling periodic background work

- A Cron Job is a Job that will be executed at specific intervals

  (the name comes from the traditional cronjobs executed by the UNIX crond)

- It requires a *schedule*, represented as five space-separated fields:

  - minute [0,59]
  - hour [0,23]
  - day of the month [1,31]
  - month of the year [1,12]
  - day of the week ([0,6] with 0=Sunday)

- `*` means "all valid values"; `/N` means "every N"

- Example: `*/3 * * * *` means "every three minutes"

---

## Creating a Cron Job

- Let's create a simple job to be executed every three minutes

- Careful: make sure that the job terminates!

  (The Cron Job will not hold if a previous job is still running)

.exercise[

- Create the Cron Job:
  ```bash
    kubectl create cronjob every3mins --schedule="*/3 * * * *" \
            --image=alpine -- sleep 10
  ```

- Check the resource that was created:
  ```bash
  kubectl get cronjobs
  ```

]

---

## Cron Jobs in action

- At the specified schedule, the Cron Job will create a Job

- The Job will create a Pod

- The Job will make sure that the Pod completes

  (re-creating another one if it fails, for instance if its node fails)

.exercise[

- Check the Jobs that are created:
  ```bash
  kubectl get jobs
  ```

]

(It will take a few minutes before the first job is scheduled.)

## What about `kubectl run` before v1.18?

- Creating a Deployment:

  `kubectl run`

- Creating a Pod:

  `kubectl run --restart=Never`

- Creating a Job:

  `kubectl run --restart=OnFailure`

- Creating a Cron Job:

  `kubectl run --restart=OnFailure --schedule=...`

*Avoid using these forms, as they are deprecated since Kubernetes 1.18!*

---

## Beyond `kubectl create`

- As hinted earlier, `kubectl create` doesn't always expose all options

  - can't express parallelism or completions of Jobs

  - can't express Pods with multiple containers

  - can't express healthchecks, resource limits

  - etc.

- `kubectl create` and `kubectl run` are *helpers* that generate YAML manifests

- If we write these manifests ourselves, we can use all features and options

- We'll see later how to do that!

# R01- Configuring **_üé∏ROCKY_** deployment with Flux

The **_‚öôÔ∏èOPS_** team manages 2 distinct envs: _**‚öóÔ∏èTEST**_ et _**üöúPROD**_
Thanks to _Kustomize_
  1. it creates a **_base_** common config
  2. this common config is overwritten with a _**‚öóÔ∏èTEST**_ _tenant_-specific configuration
  3. the same applies with a _**üöúPROD**_-specific configuration

> üí° This seems complex, but no worries: Flux's CLI handles the essentials.

## Creating the **_üé∏ROCKY_**-dedicated _tenant_ in _**‚öóÔ∏èTEST**_ env

- Using the `flux` _CLI_, we create the file configuring the **_üé∏ROCKY_** team's dedicated _tenant_‚Ä¶
- ‚Ä¶ this file takes place in the `base` common configuration for both envs

.lab[

```bash
k8s@shpod:~/fleet-config-using-flux-XXXXX$ \
    mkdir -p ./tenants/base/rocky &&       \
    flux create tenant rocky               \
        --with-namespace=rocky-test        \
        --cluster-role=rocky-full-access   \
        --export > ./tenants/base/rocky/rbac.yaml
```

]

---

### üìÇ ./tenants/base/rocky/rbac.yaml

Let's see our file‚Ä¶

3 resources are created:

- `Namespace`, 
- a `ServiceAccount` and
- a `ClusterRoleBinding`

`Flux` impersonates as this `ServiceAccount` when it applies any resources found in this tenant-dedicated source(s)
By default, the `ServiceAccount` is bound to a `ClusterRole` named `cluster-admin`  

It means that, any team that maintain the sourced `Github` repository is able to apply Kubernetes resources as `cluster-admin`  
A not that much isolated tenant! üòï

That's why the **_‚öôÔ∏èOPS_** team forces a binding to a specific `ClusterRole`  
Let's create this ClusterRole permissions!

---

## _namespace_ isolation for **_üé∏ROCKY_**


.lab[

- Here is a `ClusterRole` with permissions restricted to the dedicated `Namespace`
```bash
k8s@shpod:~/fleet-config-using-flux-XXXXX$ \
    cp ~/container.training/k8s/M6-rocky-cluster-role.yaml ./tenants/base/rocky/
```

]

---

## Creating `Github` source in Flux for **_üé∏ROCKY_** app repository

A specific _branch_ of the `Github` repository is monitored by the `Flux` source

.lab[

- ‚ö†Ô∏è you may change the **repository URL** to the one of your own clone
```bash
k8s@shpod:~/fleet-config-using-flux-XXXXX$ flux create source git rocky-app \
    --namespace=rocky-test                                                  \
    --url=https://github.com/Musk8teers/container.training-spring-music/    \
    --branch=rocky  --export > ./tenants/base/rocky/sync.yaml
k8s@shpod:~/fleet-config-using-flux-XXXXX$ flux create kustomization rocky \
    --namespace=rocky-test                                                 \
    --service-account=rocky                                                \
    --source=GitRepository/rocky-app                                       \
    --path="./k8s/" --export >> ./tenants/base/rocky/sync.yaml
k8s@shpod:~/fleet-config-using-flux-XXXXX$ cd ./tenants/base/rocky/ && \
    kustomize create --autodetect && cd -
```

]

---

### üìÇ Flux config files

Let's review our `Flux` configuration files

.lab[

```bash
k8s@shpod:~/fleet-config-using-flux-XXXXX$ \
    cat ./tenants/base/rocky/sync.yaml &&  \
    cat ./tenants/base/rocky/kustomization.yaml
```

]

---

## Adding a kustomize patch for _**‚öóÔ∏èTEST**_ cluster deployment

Remember!  
The `Flux` tenant-dedicated configuration is looking for this file `.tenants/test/rocky/kustomization.yaml`  
It has been configured here: `clusters/CLOUDY/tenants.yaml`

All the files we just created are located in `.tenants/base/rocky` (remember the DRY strategy)

So we have to create a specific kustomization in the right location

```bash
k8s@shpod:~/fleet-config-using-flux-XXXXX$ \ 
    mkdir -p ./tenants/test/rocky &&       \
    cp ~/container.training/k8s/M6-rocky-test-patch.yaml ./tenants/test/rocky/ && \
    cp ~/container.training/k8s/M6-rocky-test-kustomization.yaml ./tenants/test/rocky/kustomization.yaml
```

---

### Synchronizing Flux config with its Github repo

Locally, our `Flux` config repo is ready  
The ops team has to push it to `Github`

.lab[

```bash
k8s@shpod:~/fleet-config-using-flux-XXXXX$ \
    git add . && \
    git commit -m':wrench: :construction_worker: add ROCKY tenant configuration' && \
    git push
```

### Flux resources for ROCKY tenant 1/2

.lab[

```bash
k8s@shpod:~$ flux get all -A

And here is our 2nd Flux error(s)! üòÖ

class: extra-details

### Flux Kustomization, mutability, ‚Ä¶

üîç Notice that none of the expected resources is created:  
the whole kustomization is rejected, even if the `StatefulSet` is this only resource that fails!

üîç Flux Kustomization uses the dry-run feature to templatize the resources and then applying patches onto them  
Good but some resources are not completely mutable, such as `StatefulSets`

We have to fix the mutation by applying the change without having to patch the resource.

üîç Simply add the `spec.targetNamespace: rocky-test` to the `Kustomization` named `rocky`

## And then it's deployed

You should see the following resources in the `rocky-test` namespace

## Upgrading ROCKY app

The Git source named `rocky-app` is pointing at
- a Github repository named [https://github.com/Musk8teers/container.training-spring-music/]
- on its branch named `rocky`

This branch deploy the v1.0.0 of the _Web_ app:
`spec.template.spec.containers.image: ghcr.io/musk8teers/container.training-spring-music:1.0.0`

What happens if we upgrade this branch to deploy `v1.0.1` of the _Web_ app?

## tenant **_üè≠PROD_**

**_üè≠PROD_** tenant is still waiting for its `Flux` configuration, but don't bother for it right now.

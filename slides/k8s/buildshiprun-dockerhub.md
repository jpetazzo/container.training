## Using images from the Docker Hub

- For everyone's convenience, we took care of building DockerCoins images

- We pushed these images to the DockerHub, under the [dockercoins](https://hub.docker.com/u/dockercoins) user

- These images are *tagged* with a version number, `v0.1`

- The full image names are therefore:

  - `dockercoins/hasher:v0.1`

  - `dockercoins/rng:v0.1`

  - `dockercoins/webui:v0.1`

  - `dockercoins/worker:v0.1`

---

## Setting `$REGISTRY` and `$TAG`

- In the upcoming exercises and labs, we use a couple of environment variables:

  - `$REGISTRY` as a prefix to all image names

  - `$TAG` as the image version tag

- For example, the worker image is `$REGISTRY/worker:$TAG`

- If you copy-paste the commands in these exercises:

  **make sure that you set `$REGISTRY` and `$TAG` first!**

- For example:
  ```bash
  export REGISTRY=dockercoins TAG=v0.1
  ```

  (this will expand `$REGISTRY/worker:$TAG` to `dockercoins/worker:v0.1`)

## Pre-requirements

- Familiarity with the UNIX command-line

  (navigating directories, editing files, using `kubectl`)

- Hands-on experience working with containers

  (building images, running them; doesn't matter how exactly)

- Kubernetes concepts

  (pods, deployments, services, labels, selectors)

- Ideally, you already have access to a Kubernetes cluster

  (even if it's just a local one with KinD, minikube, etc.)

# Owners and dependents

- Some objects are created by other objects

  (example: pods created by replica sets, themselves created by deployments)

- When an *owner* object is deleted, its *dependents* are deleted

  (this is the default behavior; it can be changed)

- We can delete a dependent directly if we want

  (but generally, the owner will recreate another right away)

- An object can have multiple owners

---

## Finding out the owners of an object

- The owners are recorded in the field `ownerReferences` in the `metadata` block

.exercise[

- Let's create a deployment running `nginx`:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment yanginx --image=nginx
  ```

- Scale it to a few replicas:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment yanginx --replicas=3
  ```

- Once it's up, check the corresponding pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -l app=yanginx -o yaml | head -n 25
  ```

]

These pods are owned by a ReplicaSet named yanginx-xxxxxxxxxx.

---

## Listing objects with their owners

- This is a good opportunity to try the `custom-columns` output!

.exercise[

- Show all pods with their owners:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod -o custom-columns=\
  NAME:.metadata.name,\
  OWNER-KIND:.metadata.ownerReferences[0].kind,\
  OWNER-NAME:.metadata.ownerReferences[0].name
  ```

]

Note: the `custom-columns` option should be one long option (without spaces),
so the lines should not be indented (otherwise the indentation will insert spaces).

---

## Deletion policy

- When deleting an object through the API, three policies are available:

  - foreground (API call returns after all dependents are deleted)

  - background (API call returns immediately; dependents are scheduled for deletion)

  - orphan (the dependents are not deleted)

- When deleting an object with `kubectl`, this is selected with `--cascade`:

  - `--cascade=true` deletes all dependent objects (default)

  - `--cascade=false` orphans dependent objects

---

## What happens when an object is deleted

- It is removed from the list of owners of its dependents

- If, for one of these dependents, the list of owners becomes empty ...

  - if the policy is "orphan", the object stays

  - otherwise, the object is deleted

---

## Orphaning pods

- We are going to delete the Deployment and Replica Set that we created

- ... without deleting the corresponding pods!

.exercise[

- Delete the Deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete deployment -l app=yanginx --cascade=false
  ```

- Delete the Replica Set:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete replicaset -l app=yanginx --cascade=false
  ```

- Check that the pods are still here:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

---

class: extra-details

## When and why would we have orphans?

- If we remove an owner and explicitly instruct the API to orphan dependents

  (like on the previous slide)

- If we change the labels on a dependent, so that it's not selected anymore

  (e.g. change the `app: yanginx` in the pods of the previous example)

- If a deployment tool that we're using does these things for us

- If there is a serious problem within API machinery or other components

  (i.e. "this should not happen")

---

## Finding orphan objects

- We're going to output all pods in JSON format

- Then we will use `jq` to keep only the ones *without* an owner

- And we will display their name

.exercise[

- List all pods that *do not* have an owner:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod -o json | jq -r "
          .items[]
          | select(.metadata.ownerReferences|not)
          | .metadata.name"
  ```

]

---

## Deleting orphan pods

- Now that we can list orphan pods, deleting them is easy

.exercise[

- Add `| xargs kubectl delete pod` to the previous command:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod -o json | jq -r "
          .items[]
          | select(.metadata.ownerReferences|not)
          | .metadata.name" | xargs kubectl delete pod
  ```

]

As always, the [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/garbage-collection/) has useful extra information and pointers.

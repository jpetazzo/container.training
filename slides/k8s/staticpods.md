# Static pods

Question: can we host the control plane of a cluster *on the cluster itself?*

- To create a Pod, we need to communicate with the API server

- The API server needs etcd to be up

- Then the Pod needs to be bound to a node by the scheduler

- So... all these things need to be running already!

- Even if the Pod already exists, we still need API server and etcd

  (so that kubelet can connect to the API server and "know" about the Pod)

---

## Static pods

Solution: run (parts of) the control plane in *static pods!*

- Normally, kubelet queries the API server to know what pods to run

- Additionally, we can tell kubelet to run pods:

  - by storing manifests in a directory (`--pod-manifest-path`)

  - by retrieving manifests from an HTTP server (`--manifest-url`)

- These manifests should be normal pod manifests

  (make sure to include the namespace in the metadata block!)

- kubelet will append the node name after the pod name

---

## How and when kubelet runs static pods

- kubelet runs static pods "no matter what"

  (even if it can't connect to the API server, or if no API server is configured)

- When there is no API server configuration, that's called "standalone mode"

- Almost nothing can prevent kubelet from running these pods

  (e.g. admission controllers, pod security settings... won't apply)

- kubelet monitors the manifest path (and/or the manifest URL)

- If manifests are deleted: their pods are destroyed

- If manifests are modified: their pods are destroyed and recreated

---

## Mirror pods

- Static pods remain running even after API server connection is up

- Once the API server is up, kubelet will create *mirror pods*

- Mirror pods represent the static pods that are running

.warning[Deleting a mirror pod has no effect on the static pod!]

- kubelet will immediately recreate the mirror pod if it is deleted

.warning[Admission control can block the mirror pod, but not the static pod!]

- Since kubelet runs the static pod even if there is no connection to the API server

---

## Example

- `kubeadm` leverages static pods to run the control plane

  (etcd, API server, controller manager, scheduler)

- It "renders" a number of YAML manifests to `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`

- This is the cluster boot sequence:

  - machine boots

  - kubelet is started (typically by systemd)

  - kubelet reads static pod manifests and run them

  - control plane is up, yay!

## Pod checkpointer

- This pattern isn't used anymore, but perhaps it can provide inspiration

- The pod checkpointer automatically generates manifests of running pods

  (if they have specific labels/annotations)

- The manifests are used to restart these pods if API contact is lost

- This pattern is implemented in [openshift/pod-checkpointer-operator] and [bootkube checkpointer]

- Unfortunately, as of 2021, both seem abandoned / unmaintained ðŸ˜¢

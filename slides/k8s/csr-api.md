# The CSR API

- The Kubernetes API exposes CSR resources

- We can use these resources to issue TLS certificates

- First, we will go through a quick reminder about TLS certificates

- Then, we will see how to obtain a certificate for a user

- We will use that certificate to authenticate with the cluster

- Finally, we will grant some privileges to that user

---

## Reminder about TLS

- TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a protocol providing:

  - encryption (to prevent eavesdropping)

  - authentication (using public key cryptography)

- When we access an https:// URL, the server authenticates itself

  (it proves its identity to us; as if it were "showing its ID")

- But we can also have mutual TLS authentication (mTLS)

  (client proves its identity to server; server proves its identity to client)

---

## Authentication with certificates

- To authenticate, someone (client or server) needs:

  - a *private key* (that remains known only to them)

  - a *public key* (that they can distribute)

  - a *certificate* (associating the public key with an identity)

- A message encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with the public key

  (and vice versa)

- If I use someone's public key to encrypt/decrypt their messages,
  <br/>
  I can be certain that I am talking to them / they are talking to me

- The certificate proves that I have the correct public key for them

---

## Certificate generation workflow

This is what I do if I want to obtain a certificate.

1. Create public and private keys.

2. Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).

   (The CSR contains the identity that I claim and a public key.)

3. Send that CSR to the Certificate Authority (CA).

4. The CA verifies that I can claim the identity in the CSR.

5. The CA generates my certificate and gives it to me.

The CA (or anyone else) never needs to know my private key.

---

## The CSR API

- The Kubernetes API has a CertificateSigningRequest resource type

  (we can list them with e.g. `kubectl get csr`)

- We can create a CSR object

  (= upload a CSR to the Kubernetes API)

- Then, using the Kubernetes API, we can approve/deny the request

- If we approve the request, the Kubernetes API generates a certificate

- The certificate gets attached to the CSR object and can be retrieved

---

## Using the CSR API

- We will show how to use the CSR API to obtain user certificates

- This will be a rather complex demo

- ... And yet, we will take a few shortcuts to simplify it

  (but it will illustrate the general idea)

- The demo also won't be automated

  (we would have to write extra code to make it fully functional)

---

## General idea

- We will create a Namespace named "users"

- Each user will get a ServiceAccount in that Namespace

- That ServiceAccount will give read/write access to *one* CSR object

- Users will use that ServiceAccount's token to submit a CSR

- We will approve the CSR (or not)

- Users can then retrieve their certificate from their CSR object

- ...And use that certificate for subsequent interactions

---

## Resource naming

For a user named `jean.doe`, we will have:

- ServiceAccount `jean.doe` in Namespace `users`

- CertificateSigningRequest `users:jean.doe`

- ClusterRole `users:jean.doe` giving read/write access to that CSR

- ClusterRoleBinding `users:jean.doe` binding ClusterRole and ServiceAccount

---

## Creating the user's resources

.warning[If you want to use another name than `jean.doe`, update the YAML file!]

.exercise[

- Create the global namespace for all users:
  ```bash
  kubectl create namespace users
  ```

- Create the ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding for `jean.doe`:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/users:jean.doe.yaml
  ```

]

---

## Extracting the user's token

- Let's obtain the user's token and give it to them

  (the token will be their password)

.exercise[

- List the user's secrets:
  ```bash
  kubectl --namespace=users describe serviceaccount jean.doe
  ```

- Show the user's token:
  ```bash
  kubectl --namespace=users describe secret `jean.doe-token-xxxxx`
  ```

]

---

## Configure `kubectl` to use the token

- Let's create a new context that will use that token to access the API

.exercise[

- Add a new identity to our kubeconfig file:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-credentials token:jean.doe --token=...
  ```

- Add a new context using that identity:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-context jean.doe --user=token:jean.doe --cluster=kubernetes
  ```

]

---

## Access the API with the token

- Let's check that our access rights are set properly

.exercise[

- Try to access any resource:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```
  (This should tell us "Forbidden")

- Try to access "our" CertificateSigningRequest:
  ```bash
  kubectl get csr users:jean.doe
  ```
  (This should tell us "NotFound")

]

---

## Create a key and a CSR

- There are many tools to generate TLS keys and CSRs

- Let's use OpenSSL; it's not the best one, but it's installed everywhere

  (many people prefer cfssl, easyrsa, or other tools; that's fine too!)

.exercise[

- Generate the key and certificate signing request:
  ```bash
    openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem \
                -new -subj /CN=jean.doe/O=devs/ -out csr.pem
  ```

]

The command above generates:

- a 2048-bit RSA key, without encryption, stored in key.pem
- a CSR for the name `jean.doe` in group `devs`

---

## Inside the Kubernetes CSR object

- The Kubernetes CSR object is a thin wrapper around the CSR PEM file

- The PEM file needs to be encoded to base64 on a single line

  (we will use `base64 -w0` for that purpose)

- The Kubernetes CSR object also needs to list the right "usages"

  (these are flags indicating how the certificate can be used)

---

## Sending the CSR to Kubernetes

.exercise[

- Generate and create the CSR resource:
  ```bash
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: certificates.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: CertificateSigningRequest
    metadata:
      name: users:jean.doe
    spec:
      request: $(base64 -w0 < csr.pem)
      usages:
      - digital signature
      - key encipherment
      - client auth
    EOF
  ```

]

---

## Adjusting certificate expiration

- By default, the CSR API generates certificates valid 1 year

- We want to generate short-lived certificates, so we will lower that to 1 hour

- Fow now, this is configured [through an experimental controller manager flag](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67324)

.exercise[

- Edit the static pod definition for the controller manager:
  ```bash
  sudo vim /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml
  ```

- In the list of flags, add the following line:
  ```bash
  - --experimental-cluster-signing-duration=1h
  ```

]

---

## Verifying and approving the CSR

- Let's inspect the CSR, and if it is valid, approve it

.exercise[

- Switch back to `cluster-admin`:
  ```bash
  kctx -
  ```

- Inspect the CSR:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe csr users:jean.doe
  ```

- Approve it:
  ```bash
  kubectl certificate approve users:jean.doe
  ```

]

---

## Obtaining the certificate

.exercise[

- Switch back to the user's identity:
  ```bash
  kctx -
  ```

- Retrieve the updated CSR object and extract the certificate:
  ```bash
  kubectl get csr users:jean.doe \
          -o jsonpath={.status.certificate} \
          | base64 -d > cert.pem
  ```

- Inspect the certificate:
  ```bash
  openssl x509 -in cert.pem -text -noout
  ```

]

---

## Using the certificate

.exercise[

- Add the key and certificate to kubeconfig:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-credentials cert:jean.doe --embed-certs \
          --client-certificate=cert.pem --client-key=key.pem
  ```

- Update the user's context to use the key and cert to authenticate:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-context jean.doe --user cert:jean.doe
  ```

- Confirm that we are seen as `jean.doe` (but don't have permissions):
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

---

## What's missing?

We have just shown, step by step, a method to issue short-lived certificates for users.

To be usable in real environments, we would need to add:

- a kubectl helper to automatically generate the CSR and obtain the cert

  (and transparently renew the cert when needed)

- a Kubernetes controller to automatically validate and approve CSRs

  (checking that the subject and groups are valid)

- a way for the users to know the groups to add to their CSR

  (e.g.: annotations on their ServiceAccount + read access to the ServiceAccount)

---

## Is this realistic?

- Larger organizations typically integrate with their own directory

- The general principle, however, is the same:

  - users have long-term credentials (password, token, ...)

  - they use these credentials to obtain other, short-lived credentials

- This provides enhanced security:

  - the long-term credentials can use long passphrases, 2FA, HSM...

  - the short-term credentials are more convenient to use

  - we get strong security *and* convenience

- Systems like Vault also have certificate issuance mechanisms

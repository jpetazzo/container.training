# M01- Configuring **_üé¨MOVY_** deployment with Flux

**_üé∏ROCKY_** _tenant_ is now fully usable in **_‚öóÔ∏èTEST_** env, let's do the same for another _dev_ team: **_üé¨MOVY_**

üòà We could do it by using `Flux` _CLI_,  
but let's see if we can succeed by just adding manifests in our `Flux` configuration repository.

## Impact study

In our `Flux` configuration repository:

- Creation of the following üìÇ folders: `./tenants/[base|test]/MOVY`

- Modification of the following üìÑ file: `./clusters/CLOUDY/tenants.yaml`?
  - Well, we don't need to: the watched path include the whole `./tenants/[test]/*` folder

In the app repository:

- Creation of a `movy` branch to deploy another version of the app dedicated to movie soundtracks

---

### Creation of the üìÇ folders

.lab[

```bash
k8s@shpod:~/fleet-config-using-flux-XXXXX$ \
    cp -pr tenants/base/rocky tenants/base/movy
    cp -pr tenants/test/rocky tenants/test/movy
```

]

---

### Modification of tenants/[base|test]/movy/* üìÑ files

- For üìÑ`M6-rocky-*.yaml`, change the file names‚Ä¶
  - and update the üìÑ`kustomization.yaml` file as a result

- In any file, replace any `rocky` entry by `movy`

- In üìÑ `sync.yaml` be aware of what repository and what branch you want `Flux` to watch for **_üé¨MOVY_** app deployment.
  - for this demo, let's assume we create a `movy` branch

### What about reusing rocky-cluster-roles?

üí° In üìÑ`M6-movy-cluster-role.yaml` and üìÑ`rbac.yaml`, we could have reused the already existing `ClusterRoles`: `rocky-full-access`, and `rocky-pv-access`  

A `ClusterRole` is cluster wide. It is not dedicated to a namespace.  
- Its permissions are restrained to a specific namespace by being bound to a `ServiceAccount` by a `RoleBinding`.
- Whereas a `ClusterRoleBinding` extends the permissions to the whole cluster scope.  

But a _tenant_ is a **_tenant_** and permissions might evolved separately for **_üé∏ROCKY_** and **_üé¨MOVY_**.

So [we got to keep'em separated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHUql3OC_uU).

---

### Let-su-go!

The **_‚öôÔ∏èOPS_** team push this new tenant configuration to `Github` for `Flux` controllers to watch and catch it!

.lab[

```bash
k8s@shpod:~/fleet-config-using-flux-XXXXX$ \
    git add . && \
    git commit -m':wrench: :construction_worker: add MOVY tenant configuration' && \
    git push
```

### Another Flux error?

.lab[

- It seems that our `movy` branch is not present in the app repository

```bash
k8s@shpod:~$ flux get kustomization -A
NAMESPACE    NAME         REVISION   SUSPENDED  MESSAGE
(‚Ä¶)
flux-system  tenant-prod  False      False      kustomization path not found: stat /tmp/kustomization-113582828/tenants/prod: no such file or directory
(‚Ä¶)
movy-test    movy         False      False      Source artifact not found, retrying in 30s                                                             
```

]

---

### Creating the `movy` branch

- Let's create this new `movy` branch from `rocky` branch

.lab[

- You can force immediate reconciliation by typing this command:

```bash
k8s@shpod:~$ flux reconcile source git movy-app -n movy-test
```

]

### New branch detected

You now have a second app responding on [http://movy.test.mybestdomain.com]  
But as of now, it's just the same as the **_üé∏ROCKY_** one.  

We want a specific (pink-colored) version with a dataset full of movie soundtracks.

---

## New version of the **_üé¨MOVY_** app

In our branch `movy`‚Ä¶  
Let's modify our `deployment.yaml` file with 2 modifications.

- in `spec.template.spec.containers.image` change the container image tag to `1.0.3`

- and‚Ä¶ let's introduce some evil enthropy by changing this line‚Ä¶ üòàüòàüòà

```yaml
 value: jdbc:postgresql://db/music
```

by this one

```yaml
 value: jdbc:postgresql://db.rocky-test/music
```

And push the modifications‚Ä¶

### MOVY app is connected to ROCKY database

How evil have we been! üòà  
We connected the **_üé¨MOVY_** app to the **_üé∏ROCKY_** database.

Even if our tenants are isolated in how they manage their Kubernetes resources‚Ä¶  
pod network is still full mesh and any connection is authorized.

> The **_‚öôÔ∏èOPS_** team should fix this!

---

## Adding NetworkPolicies to **_üé∏ROCKY_** and **_üé¨MOVY_** namespaces

`Network policies` may be seen as the firewall feature in the pod network.  
They rules ingress and egress network connections considering a described subset of pods.

Please, refer to the [`Network policies` chapter in the High Five M4 module](./4.yml.html#toc-network-policies)

- In our case, we just add the file `~/container.training/k8s/M6-network-policies.yaml`
</br>in our `./tenants/base/movy` folder

- without forgetting to update our `kustomization.yaml` file

- and without forgetting to commit üòÅ

## Where are we going to run our containers?

## If you're attending a live class

- Each person gets a private lab environment

  (depending on the scenario, this will be one VM, one cluster, multiple clusters...)

- The instructor will tell you how to connect to your environment

- Your lab environments will be available for the duration of the workshop

  (check with your instructor to know exactly when they'll be shutdown)

## Why don't we run containers locally?

- Setting up a local Kubernetes cluster can take time

  (and the procedure can differ from one system to another)

- On some systems, it might be impossible

  (due to restrictive IT policies, lack of hardware support...)

- Some labs require a "real" cluster

  (e.g. multiple nodes to demonstrate failover, placement policies...)

- For on-site classes, it can stress the local network

  *"The whole team downloaded all these container images from the WiFi!
  <br/>... and it went great!"* (Literally no-one ever)

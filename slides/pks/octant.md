# Octant

Octant is an open source tool from VMWare which is designed to be a Kubernetes workload visualization tool that runs locally and uses your Kubeconfig to connect to the Kubernetes cluster.

Since Octant runs locally on your machine and only uses your kube credentials its [in theory at least] more secure than the kubernetes dashboard.

- Run octant and browse through your resources:
  ```bash
  octant
  ```
]

*We can use Octant through the workshop to see our resources running in Kubernetes. If you don't have it already installed, you can ignore it.*

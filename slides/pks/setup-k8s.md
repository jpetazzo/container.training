# Setting up Kubernetes

How did we set up these Kubernetes clusters that we're using?

--

- We used Pivotal Container Service (PKS) a multicloud Kubernetes broker.

- But first we Created a GKE Kubernetes cluster
  - We installed the Google Cloud Operator on GKE
  - We installed PKS using the GCP Operator
  - We installed this Kubernetes cluster using PKS

# Setting up Kubernetes

- How can I set up a basic Kubernetes lab at home?

--

<!-- ##VERSION## -->

- Run `kubeadm` on freshly installed VM instances running Ubuntu LTS

    1. Install Docker

    2. Install Kubernetes packages

    3. Run `kubeadm init` on the first node (it deploys the control plane on that node)

    4. Set up Weave (the overlay network)
       <br/>
       (that step is just one `kubectl apply` command; discussed later)

    5. Run `kubeadm join` on the other nodes (with the token produced by `kubeadm init`)

    6. Copy the configuration file generated by `kubeadm init`

- Check the [prepare VMs README](https://@@GITREPO@@/blob/master/prepare-vms/README.md) for more details

---

## `kubeadm` drawbacks

- Doesn't set up Docker or any other container engine

- Doesn't set up the overlay network

- Doesn't set up multi-master (no high availability)

--

  (At least ... not yet! Though it's [experimental in 1.12](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/high-availability/).)

## Even more deployment options

- If you like Ansible:
  [kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kubespray)

- If you like Terraform:
  [typhoon](https://github.com/poseidon/typhoon)

- If you like Terraform and Puppet:
  [tarmak](https://github.com/jetstack/tarmak)

- You can also learn how to install every component manually, with
  the excellent tutorial [Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)

  *Kubernetes The Hard Way is optimized for learning, which means taking the long route to ensure you understand each task required to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster.*

- There are also many commercial options available!

- For a longer list, check the Kubernetes documentation:
  <br/>
  it has a great guide to [pick the right solution](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/#production-environment) to set up Kubernetes.

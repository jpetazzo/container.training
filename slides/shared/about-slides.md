## Slides ≠ documentation

- We tried to include a lot of information in these slides

- But they don't replace or compete with the documentation!

- Treat these slides as yet another pillar to support your learning experience

- Don't hesitate to frequently read the documentations

  ([Docker documentation][docker-docs], [Kubernetes documentation][k8s-docs])

- And online communities

  (e.g.: [Docker forums][docker-forums], [Docker on StackOverflow][docker-so], [Kubernetes on StackOverflow][k8s-so])

[docker-docs]: https://docs.docker.com/
[k8s-docs]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/
[docker-forums]: https://forums.docker.com/
[docker-so]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/docker

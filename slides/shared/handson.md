## Hands-on, you shall practice

- Nobody ever became a Jedi by spending their lives reading Wookiepedia

- Someone can:

  - read all the docs

  - watch all the videos

  - attend all the workshops and live classes

- ...This won't be enough to become an expert!

- We think one needs to *put the concepts in practice* to truly memorize them

- But, how?

---

## Hands-on labs

- These slides include *tons* of demos, examples, and exercises

- Don't follow along passively; try to reproduce the demos and examples!

- Each time you see a gray rectangle like this, it indicates a demo or example

.lab[

- This is a command that we're gonna run:
  ```bash
  echo hello world
  ```

]

- Don't hesitate to try them in your environment

- Don't hesitate to improvise, deviate from the script... And see what happens!

## Use the chat!

- In the Zoom GUI, click on "Chat" (at the bottom of the screen, in the middle)

- This will bring up the chat panel

- Say hi in the group chat!

- If you'd like, you can open the chat to its own separate window:

  - click on the little `v` on the left of "Zoom Group Chat"

  - select "Pop Out"

- We will be monitoring the Zoom chat during the whole training

- Don't hesitate to use it to ask questions, or get help, or share feedback

---

## Use non-verbal communication cues

- ... wait, what?!?

--

- In the Zoom VI, click on "Participants" (at the bottom of the screen, in the middle)

- This will bring up the list of participants

- You can pop it out if you like (just like the chat window)

- At the bottom of the list of participants, there are feedback buttons:

  raise hand, yes, no, go slower, go faster

- If you click on "more" (on the right of these feedback buttons), you can also:

  thumbs down, thumbs up, applause, need a break, away

- Click on "thumbs up" to let us know that everything is working fine!

## Use your webcam (if you'd like!)

- If you would like to turn on your webcam, feel free to do so

- You don't have to, but your teacher will appreciate it :)

  (it's easier to teach and get feedback from human faces!)

- You are welcome to smile / frown / raise your hand ... through your webcam as well!

  <br/>People with their webcam on are in the front row;
  <br/>people with their webcam off are in the back row.”*

## During the session

- We will often ask "yes/no" questions; use the corresponding buttons

- If you have a question, you can ask in the chat, or use "raise hand"

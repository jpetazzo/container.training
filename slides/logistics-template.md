## Context

- This content was delivered at QCON SF in November 2024
 
  (in-person workshop)

- I recorded that workshop, but had technical issues

- This is a re-recording of the workshop!

- I may or may not cover everything in this video series

- At the conference, I provided everyone with an individual cluster

- If you want to follow along the demos and labs, you'll need your own

  (I'll explain how to provision it)

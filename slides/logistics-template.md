## Recording

- I'm going to try and record the workshop

  (on a best effort basis, using whatever equipment I could fit in my carry-on!😅)

- If you would like to receive a copy of the recording:

  *leave your contact info in the feedback form (address on the last slide)!*

- The camera will only record me (not the audience)

- If you want to ask a question "off the record": tell me and I'll pause the recording

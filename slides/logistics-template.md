## Intros & disclaimers

- Hello! I'm Jérôme Petazzoni ([@jpetazzo](https://twitter.com/jpetazzo))

- I have ...

  - extensive experience running *containers* in production
  - limited experience running *Kubernetes* in production

  - taught Docker and Kubernetes many times, to large audiences
  - less frequently taught operators and API internals

  - written a lot of Python code during my career; but much less Go

  - learned way more than I expected just by writing some chapters of this course (!)

---

## Logistics

- The training will from 8am to noon PST, Monday to Friday

- There will be short breaks every hour, and a longer break in the middle

- Feel free to interrupt for questions at any time

- *Especially when you see full screen container pictures!*

  (I will watch them in silence while I wait for your questions)

- Live feedback, questions, help: @@CHAT@@

## Course structure

Three axis:

1. Fundamental concepts, "under the hood" components 

   (think: data structures, algorithms, assembly language ...)

2. Analyzing state-of-the-art implementations

   (think: design patterns ...)

3. High-level abstractions, highly effective frameworks

   (think: Django, Ruby ...)

## The power of repetition ...

- You will notice some repetition in the beginning of some chapters

- This is to let you review some chapters in isolation, just in case

- Also, supposedly, repetition yields better learning results? 🤷🏻

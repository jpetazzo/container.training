  Swarm: from Zero to Hero

  .small[.small[

  **Be kind to the WiFi!**

  *Use the 5G network*
  <br/>
  *Don't use your hotspot*
  <br/>
  *Don't stream videos from YouTube, Netflix, etc.
  <br/>(if you're bored, watch local content instead)*

  Also: share the power outlets
  <br/>
  *(with limited power comes limited responsibility?)*
  <br/>
  *(or something?)*

  Thank you!

  ## "From zero to hero"

  --

  - It rhymes, but it's a pretty bad title, to be honest

  --
  
  - None of you is a "zero"

  --
  
  - None of us is a "hero"

  --
  
  - None of us should even try to be a hero

  --
  
    *The hero syndrome is a phenomenon affecting people who seek heroism or recognition,
    usually by creating a desperate situation which they can resolve.
    This can include unlawful acts, such as arson.
    The phenomenon has been noted to affect civil servants,
    such as firefighters, nurses, police officers, and security guards.*

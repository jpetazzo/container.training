# Kubernetes concepts

- Kubernetes is a container management system

- It runs and manages containerized applications on a cluster

--

- What does that really mean?

---

## Basic things we can ask Kubernetes to do

--

- Start 5 containers using image `atseashop/api:v1.3`

--

- Place an internal load balancer in front of these containers

--

- Start 10 containers using image `atseashop/webfront:v1.3`

--

- Place a public load balancer in front of these containers

--

- It's Black Friday (or Christmas), traffic spikes, grow our cluster and add containers

--

- New release! Replace my containers with the new image `atseashop/webfront:v1.4`

--

- Keep processing requests during the upgrade; update my containers one at a time

---

## Other things that Kubernetes can do for us

- Basic autoscaling

- Blue/green deployment, canary deployment

- Long running services, but also batch (one-off) jobs

- Overcommit our cluster and *evict* low-priority jobs

- Run services with *stateful* data (databases etc.)

- Fine-grained access control defining *what* can be done by *whom* on *which* resources

- Integrating third party services (*service catalog*)

- Automating complex tasks (*operators*)

## Kubernetes architecture

- Ha ha ha ha

- OK, I was trying to scare you, it's much simpler than that ❤️

## Kubernetes architecture: the master

- The Kubernetes logic (its "brains") is a collection of services:

  - the API server (our point of entry to everything!)
  - core services like the scheduler and controller manager
  - `etcd` (a highly available key/value store; the "database" of Kubernetes)

- Together, these services form what is called the "master"

- These services can run straight on a host, or in containers
  <br/>
  (that's an implementation detail)

- `etcd` can be run on separate machines (first schema) or co-located (second schema)

- We need at least one master, but we can have more (for high availability)

---

## Kubernetes architecture: the nodes

- The nodes executing our containers run another collection of services:

  - a container Engine (typically Docker)
  - kubelet (the "node agent")
  - kube-proxy (a necessary but not sufficient network component)

- Nodes were formerly called "minions"

- It is customary to *not* run apps on the node(s) running master components

  (Except when using small development clusters) 

---

## Do we need to run Docker at all?

No!

--

- By default, Kubernetes uses the Docker Engine to run containers

- We could also use `rkt` ("Rocket") from CoreOS

- Or leverage other pluggable runtimes through the *Container Runtime Interface*

  (like CRI-O, or containerd)

---

## Do we need to run Docker at all?

Yes!

--

- In this workshop, we run our app on a single node first

- We will need to build images and ship them around

- We can do these things without Docker
  <br/>
  (and get diagnosed with NIH¹ syndrome)

- Docker is still the most stable container engine today
  <br/>
  (but other options are maturing very quickly)

## Do we need to run Docker at all?

- On our development environments, CI pipelines ... :

  *Yes, almost certainly*

- On our production servers:

  *Yes (today)*

  *Probably not (in the future)*

## Kubernetes resources

- The Kubernetes API defines a lot of objects called *resources*

- These resources are organized by type, or `Kind` (in the API)

- A few common resource types are:

  - node (a machine — physical or virtual — in our cluster)
  - pod (group of containers running together on a node)
  - service (stable network endpoint to connect to one or multiple containers)
  - namespace (more-or-less isolated group of things)
  - secret (bundle of sensitive data to be passed to a container)
 
  And much more! (We can see the full list by running `kubectl get`)

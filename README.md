# Docker Orchestration Workshop

This is the material (slides, scripts, demo app, and other
code samples) for the "Docker orchestration workshop"
written and delivered by Jérôme Petazzoni (and lots of others)
non-stop since June 2015.


## Content

The workshop introduces a demo app, "DockerCoins," built
around a micro-services architecture. First, we run it
on a single node, using Docker Compose. Then, we pretend
that we need to scale it, and we use an orchestrator
(SwarmKit or Kubernetes) to deploy and scale the app on
a cluster.

We explain the concepts of the orchestrator. For SwarmKit,
we setup the cluster with `docker swarm init` and `docker swarm join`.
For Kubernetes, we use pre-configured clusters.

Then, we cover more advanced concepts: scaling, load balancing,
updates, global services or daemon sets.

There are a number of advanced optional chapters about
logging, metrics, secrets, network encryption, etc.

The content is very modular: it is broken down in a large
number of Markdown files, that are put together according
to a YAML manifest. This allows to re-use content
between different workshops very easily.


## Quick start (or, "I want to try it!")

This workshop is designed to be *hands on*, i.e. to give you a step-by-step
guide where you will build your own Docker cluster, and use it to deploy
a sample application.

The easiest way to follow the workshop is to attend it when it is delivered
by an instructor. In that case, the instructor will generally give you
credentials (IP addresses, login, password) to connect to your own cluster
of virtual machines; and the [slides](http://jpetazzo.github.io/container.training)
assume that you have your own cluster indeed.

If you want to follow the workshop on your own, and want to have your
own cluster, we have multiple solutions for you!


### Using [play-with-docker](http://play-with-docker.com/)

This method is very easy to get started: you don't need any extra account
or resources! It works only for the SwarmKit version of the workshop, though.

To get started, go to [play-with-docker](http://play-with-docker.com/), and
click on _ADD NEW INSTANCE_ five times. You will get five "docker-in-docker"
containers, all on a private network. These are your five nodes for the workshop!

When the instructions in the slides tell you to "SSH on node X", just go to
the tab corresponding to that node.

The nodes are not directly reachable from outside; so when the slides tell
you to "connect to the IP address of your node on port XYZ" you will have
to use a different method: click on the port number that should appear on
top of the play-with-docker window. This only works for HTTP services,
though.

Note that the instances provided by Play-With-Docker have a short lifespan
(a few hours only), so if you want to do the workshop over multiple sessions,
you will have to start over each time ... Or create your own cluster with
one of the methods described below.


### Using Docker Machine to create your own cluster

This method requires a bit more work to get started, but you get a permanent
cluster, with less limitations.

You will need Docker Machine (if you have Docker Mac, Docker Windows, or
the Docker Toolbox, you're all set already). You will also need:

- credentials for a cloud provider (e.g. API keys or tokens),
- or a local install of VirtualBox or VMware (or anything supported
  by Docker Machine).

Full instructions are in the [prepare-machine](prepare-machine) subdirectory.


### Using our scripts to mass-create a bunch of clusters

Since we often deliver the workshop during conferences or similar events,
we have scripts to automate the creation of a bunch of clusters using
AWS EC2. If you want to create multiple clusters and have EC2 credits,
check the [prepare-vms](prepare-vms) directory for more information.


## How This Repo is Organized

- **dockercoins**
  - Sample App: compose files and source code for the dockercoins sample apps
  used throughout the workshop
- **docs**
  - Slide Deck: presentation slide deck, works out-of-box with GitHub Pages,
  uses https://remarkjs.com
- **prepare-local**
  - untested scripts for automating the creation of local virtualbox VM's
  (could use your help validating)
- **prepare-machine**
  - instructions explaining how to use Docker Machine to create VMs
- **prepare-vms**
  - scripts for automating the creation of AWS instances for students


## Slide Deck

- The slides are in the `docs` directory.
- For each slide deck, there is a `.yml` file referencing `.md` files.
- The `.md` files contain Markdown snippets.
- When you run `build.sh once`, it will "compile" all the `.yml` files
  into `.yml.html` files that you can open in your browser.
- You can also run `build.sh forever`, which will watch the directory
  and rebuild slides automatically when files are modified.
- If needed, you can fine-tune `workshop.css` and `workshop.html`
  (respectively the CSS style used, and the boilerplate template).
- The slides use https://remarkjs.com to render Markdown into HTML in
  a web browser.


## Sample App: Dockercoins!

The sample app is in the `dockercoins` directory. It's used during all chapters
for explaining different concepts of orchestration.

To see it in action:

- `cd dockercoins && docker-compose up -d`
- this will build and start all the services
- the web UI will be available on port 8000


*If you just want to run the workshop for yourself, you can stop reading
here. If you want to deliver the workshop for others (i.e. if you
want to become an instructor), keep reading!*


## Running the Workshop


### General timeline of planning a workshop

- Fork repo and run through slides, doing the hands-on to be sure you
  understand the different `dockercoins` repo's and the steps we go through to
  get to a full Swarm Mode cluster of many containers. You'll update the first
  few slides and last slide at a minimum, with your info.
- Your docs directory can use GitHub Pages.
- This workshop expects 5 servers per student. You can get away with as little
  as 2 servers per student, but you'll need to change the slide deck to
  accommodate. More servers = more fun.
- If you have more then ~20 students, try to get an assistant (TA) to help
  people with issues, so you don't have to stop the workshop to help someone
  with ssh etc.
- AWS is our most tested process for generating student machines. In
  `prepare-vms` you'll find scripts to create EC2 instances, install docker,
  pre-pull images, and even print "cards" to place at each students seat with
  IP's and username/password.
- Test AWS Scripts: Be sure to test creating *all* your needed servers a week
  before workshop (just for a few minutes). You'll likely hit AWS limits in the
  region closest to your class, and it sometimes takes days to get AWS to raise
  those limits with a support ticket.
- Create a https://gitter.im chat room for your workshop and update slides
  with url. Also useful for TA to monitor this during workshop. You can use it
  before/after to answer questions, and generally works as a better answer then
  "email me that question".
- If you can send an email to students ahead of time, mention how they should
  get SSH, and test that SSH works. If they can `ssh github.com` and get
  `permission denied (publickey)` then they know it worked, and SSH is properly
  installed and they don't have anything blocking it. SSH and a browser are all
  they need for class.
- Typically you create the servers the day before or morning of workshop, and
  leave them up the rest of day after workshop. If creating hundreds of servers,
  you'll likely want to run all these `workshopctl` commands from a dedicated
  instance you have in same region as instances you want to create. Much faster
  this way if you're on poor internet. Also, create 2 sets of servers for
  yourself, and use one during workshop and the 2nd is a backup.
- Remember you'll need to print the "cards" for students, so you'll need to
  create instances while you have a way to print them.

### Things That Could Go Wrong

- Creating AWS instances ahead of time, and you hit its limits in region and
  didn't plan enough time to wait on support to increase your limits. :(
- Students have technical issues during workshop. Can't get ssh working,
  locked-down computer, host firewall, etc.
- Horrible wifi, or ssh port TCP/22 not open on network! If wifi sucks you
  can try using MOSH https://mosh.org which handles SSH over UDP. TMUX can also
  prevent you from loosing your place if you get disconnected from servers.
  https://tmux.github.io
- Forget to print "cards" and cut them up for handing out IP's.
- Forget to have fun and focus on your students!

### Creating the VMs

`prepare-vms/workshopctl` is the script that gets you most of what you need for
setting up instances. See
[prepare-vms/README.md](prepare-vms)
for all the info on tools and scripts.

### Content for Different Workshop Durations

With all the slides, this workshop is a full day long. If you need to deliver
it in shorter timelines, here's some recommendations on what to cut out. You
can replace `---` with `???` which will hide slides. Or leave them there and
add something like `(EXTRA CREDIT)` to title so students can still view the
content but you also know to skip during presentation.

#### 3 Hour Version

- Limit time on debug tools, maybe skip a few. *"Chapter 1:
  Identifying bottlenecks"*
- Limit time on Compose, try to have them building the Swarm Mode by 30
  minutes in
- Skip most of Chapter 3, Centralized Logging and ELK
- Skip most of Chapter 4, but keep stateful services and DAB's if possible
- Mention what DAB's are, but make this part optional in case you run out
  of time

#### 2 Hour Version

- Skip all the above, and:
- Skip the story arc of debugging dockercoins all together, skipping the
  troubleshooting tools. Just focus on getting them from single-host to
  multi-host and multi-container.
- Goal is first 30min on intro and Docker Compose and what dockercoins is,
  and getting it up on one node in docker-compose.
- Next 60-75 minutes is getting dockercoins in Swarm Mode services across
  servers. Big Win.
- Last 15-30 minutes is for stateful services, DAB files, and questions.
